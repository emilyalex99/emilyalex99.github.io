Hello! I'm Emily. Originally from Chicago, I moved to New York City three years ago and since then I've had a wonderful time living in the big apple! While Chicago and New York may seem like incredibly different places, they have one thing in common; they are both big foodie cities (And both have great pizza). During my three years in New York, I've explored the many cuisines that this big beautiful city consists of, and let me say; New York has the best of the best. From Thai to Ethiopian to American, New York has a little of everything. During my quest to taste all that New York has to offer (which has proven to be impossible), I decided to document my food adventures, thoughts and photographs. For a while, my beautiful food photographs sat uneventufully in my iPhone photo album. Although now, they will be displayed on this website for all to drool over. So, with that in mind, I hope you enjoy my blog and foodie insights. With love, Emily
